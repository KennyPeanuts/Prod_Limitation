# Experimental Design for the effect of CPOM on the limitation of pelagic PPR in LPP

## Spring 2015

## KF and JM

### Research Question

How does the presence of CPOM in the sediments affect the limitation of PPR in small ponds?

#### Background

Initial bioassays show that phytoplankton PPR in LPP is limited by N in the late winter/early spring.

The presence of CPOM in the sediments of LPP resulted in a decrease in the release of NOx from the sediments to the water column in the first days of the incubation.

The combination of these observations suggests that CPOM may affect the nutrient availability to phytoplankton in the pond.

### Hypothesis

H1: The presence of CPOM will increase the N limitation of the phytoplankton and result in an reduced Chl-a concentration in the overlying water.

#### Hypothesized Mechanism

I think the fungi are immobilizing N during the initial colonization of the litter. Once the fungal biomass has stabilized, the N uptake and mineralization reach equilibrium and there is no net immobilization.

### Design

Treatment = presence of CPOM

Treatment levels:

1. No CPOM - pond sediment filtered through 250 um mesh

2. CPOM - 20, 10 mm senescent tulip poplar leaf disks added to each bottle.

Response = the change in Chl-a concentration of the overlying water after 7 d of incubation in the greenhouse.

Replication = 5 replicates of each treatment level 

### Procedure

1. Acid wash BOD bottles 

2. Collect sediments from 1 m water depth in LPP using the Ekman

3. Collect 4 L of surface water from LPP store in refrigerator

4. Filter sediments through 250 um mesh in the field to remove all macroinvertebrates and CPOM

5. Allow sediments to settle for ~ 24 h and siphon off overlying water

6. Gently add 100 ml of sediment to each BOD bottle

7. Filter overlying water through 63 um and gently add 150 ml to the sediment-filled bottles, limiting re-suspension.

8. Allow bottles to settle for 24 h, remove most of the overlying water with syringe.

9. Add CPOM disks to randomly selected BOD bottles.

10. Gently add 150 ml of overlying water back to bottles

11. Cap with foam stopper and place in the greenhouse. 

12. Collect 5 replicate Chl-a samples onto GFF filters from initial water and freeze.

13. Measure incident light in greenhouse

14. Place HOBO logger in greenhouse

15. After 7 d of incubation, collect Chl-a samples from each bottle onto GFF

16. In 15 ml conical tube, extract Chl-a from each filter (10 bottles + 5 initial) with 90% acetone for ~24 h.

17. Read fluorescence on Turner Trilogy.
