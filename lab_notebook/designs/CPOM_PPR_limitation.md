# Experimental Design for the effect of CPOM on the limitation of pelagic PPR in LPP

## Spring 2015

## KF and JM

* Modified 18 March 2015 - KF - added sample collection details

### Research Question

How does the presence of CPOM in the sediments affect the limitation of PPR in small ponds?

#### Background

Initial bioassays show that phytoplankton PPR in LPP is limited by N in the late winter/early spring.

The presence of CPOM in the sediments of LPP resulted in a decrease in the release of NOx from the sediments to the water column in the first days of the incubation.

The combination of these observations suggests that CPOM may affect the nutrient availability to phytoplankton in the pond.

### Hypothesis

H1: The presence of CPOM will increase the N limitation of the phytoplankton and result in an reduced Chl-a concentration in the overlying water.

#### Hypothesized Mechanism

I think the fungi are immobilizing N during the initial colonization of the litter. Once the fungal biomass has stabilized, the N uptake and mineralization reach equilibrium and there is no net immobilization.

### Design

Treatment = presence of CPOM

Treatment levels:

1. No CPOM - pond sediment filtered through 250 um mesh

2. CPOM - 20, 10 mm senescent tulip poplar leaf disks added to each bottle.

Response = the change in Chl-a concentration of the overlying water after 7 d of incubation in the greenhouse.

Replication = 5 replicates of each treatment level 

### Procedure

1. Acid wash BOD bottles 

2. Collect sediments from 1 m water depth in LPP using the Ekman

3. Collect 4 L of surface water from LPP store in refrigerator

4. Filter sediments through 250 um mesh in the field to remove all macroinvertebrates and CPOM

5. Allow sediments to settle for ~ 24 h and siphon off overlying water

6. Gently add 100 ml of sediment to each BOD bottle

7. Filter overlying water through 63 um and gently add 150 ml to the sediment-filled bottles, limiting re-suspension.

8. Allow bottles to settle for 24 h, remove most of the overlying water with syringe.

9. Add CPOM disks to randomly selected BOD bottles.

10. Gently add 150 ml of overlying water back to bottles

11. Cap with foam stopper and place in the greenhouse. 

12. Collect 5 replicate Chl-a samples onto GFF filters from initial water and freeze.

13. Measure incident light in greenhouse

14. Place HOBO logger in greenhouse

15. After 7 d of incubation, collect Chl-a samples from each bottle onto GFF

16. In 15 ml conical tube, extract Chl-a from each filter (10 bottles + 5 initial) with 90% acetone for ~24 h.

17. Read fluorescence on Turner Trilogy. 

### Schedule

* Before March 11 - acid wash bottles

* March 11 - Set up bottles (steps 2 - 7)
 
* March 12 - Add CPOM (steps 8 - 14)

* March 18 - Collect Chl-a (steps 15 - 16)

* March 19 - Read fluorescence (step 17)

### Sampling Procedure Details

After the incubation it is clear that there is more going on than simple changes in algal biomass. The details of the observations are in `CPOM_PPR_limitation_incubation_notes_sp2015.md`

Based on these observations, we need to collect more samples to fully understand what is happening in the bottles and system.

#### Sample List

1. Chl-a (GFF, frozen)

2. Absorbance (5 ml, filtered)

3. Nutrients (30 ml, filtered)

4. pH (whole bottle unfiltered)

5. Surface Sediment Chl-a (1 X 0.8 cm core)

6. Surface Sediment OM (1 X 0.8 cm core)

7. Total Sediment OM (n X 0.8 cm core)

8. CPOM AFDM (19 disks)

9. CPOM algal community (1 disk wet mount)

10. Benthic algal community (surface sediment wet mount)

#### Sampling Protocol

1. Remove 19 CPOM disks from BOD bottle and place in pre-weighed crucible

2. Make a wet-mount of a single disk - take photo

3. Measure pH of the water

4. Remove 5 ml of water from BOD and filter through GFF into 15 ml conical tube for absorbance.

5. Remove 30 ml of water from BOD and filter through the same GFF into a 50 ml conical tube to freeze for nutrients

6. Continue to filter water through GFF until adequate Chl-a sample is collected on the filter

7. Siphon off the remaining overlying water from each BOD

8. Collect a surface sediment core from the BOD and add to a pre-weighed scintillation vial

9. Collect a total sediment core and add to a pre-weighed scintillation vial

10. Collect a surface sediment core and dilute in a 50 ml conical tube to 30 ml with DI water

11. Filter 10 ml of the diluted and homogenized sediment onto a GFF

12. Collect a surface sediment core and make a wet-mount
