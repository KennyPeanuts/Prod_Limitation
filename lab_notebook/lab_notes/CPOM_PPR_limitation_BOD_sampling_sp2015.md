## Purpose

Sample collection at the conclusion of the incubation for the CPOM-PPR limitation Exp.

## Sampling Notes

The sample bottles were removed from the greenhouse at approximately 1:00 PM on 18 March 2015, which concluded 6 days of incubation under the ambient conditions of the greenhouse.

The leaf discs were removed from the CPOM-containing bottles to the best of our ability but the leaves had clumped together with the sediment and were hard to find in some cases.  All of the leaves that were found were collected and added to pre-weighed crucibles
