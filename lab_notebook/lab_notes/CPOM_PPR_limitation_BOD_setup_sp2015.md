## Purpose

Field collection of sediments and water to fill the BOD bottles for the CPOM-PPR Limitation Exp.

## Procedure
### Sediment Collection

Sediments were collected from LPP near the shoreline by the inlet and by the dam-side opposite the outlet. In both cases we waded out with waders to water that was approximately 0.7 m deep and collected several Ekman dredges that were combined into a single basin.

The sediments contained a lot of CPOM but the Ekman was able to close.

The sediments were returned to shore and washed through a 250 um mesh net to remove CPOM and macroinvertebrates.

The sieved, CPOM-free sediments were then returned to the lab and stirred to homogenize.

250 ml of the homogenized sediments were then added to each BOD bottle.

### Water Collection

4 L of surface water was collected  from near the inlet. The water was returned to the lab and refrigerated.

## Notes

The lake level was up and the water was somewhat turbid from the recent rain.

There were some old mats of filamentous algae near the shoreline.
