## Purpose

Field collection of sediments and water to fill the BOD bottles for the CPOM-PPR Limitation Exp.

## Procedure
### Sediment Collection

Sediments were collected from LPP near the shoreline by the inlet and by the dam-side opposite the outlet. In both cases we waded out with waders to water that was approximately 0.7 m deep and collected several Ekman dredges that were combined into a single basin.

The sediments contained a lot of CPOM but the Ekman was able to close.

The sediments were returned to shore and washed through a 250 um mesh net to remove CPOM and macroinvertebrates.

The sieved, CPOM-free sediments were then returned to the lab and stirred to homogenize.

250 ml of the homogenized sediments were then added to each BOD
bottle.

#### Revised Procedure

Adding 250 ml of the sediment slurry resulted in too much sediment once it settled so the bottles were emptied and refilled with only 150 ml of sediment slurry and 100 ml of filtered (63 um) lake water.

I then allowed the bottles to settle for approximately 12 h

After this settling period, I removed 120 ml of overlying water from each with a syringe and then replaced it with 120 ml of filtered (63 um) lake water, taking care not to stir the sediment.

Following this procedure the settled sediment appears to be around 100 ml and is a uniform dark grey with about 1 mm of lighter grey at the sediment water interface. This surface layer is somewhat cohesive and "peels up" when the sediments are disturbed.

Approximately 6 h later  we removed another 120 ml of the overlying water and replaced it with filtered (63 um) lake water.

This was the final replacement. After this the leaves were added (see below).

### Water Collection

4 L of surface water was collected  from near the inlet. The water was returned to the lab and refrigerated.

## Notes

The lake level was up and the water was somewhat turbid from the recent rain.

There were some old mats of filamentous algae near the shoreline. 

### Treatment Assignment and Set-up

The treatments were assigned to bottles using a random number table

| Treatment | BOD Bottle Number |
| --------  |   --------------- |
| CPOM      |                 8 |
| CPOM      |                 3 |
| CPOM      |                 1 |
| CPOM      |                 7 |
| CPOM      |                 4 |
| Ctl       |                 6 |
| Ctl       |                 5 |
| Ctl       |                 9 |
| Ctl       |                 2 |
| Ctl       |                10 |
|           |                   |

To each of the bottles designated CPOM, we added 20, 10 mm leaf disks cut from senecent tulip poplar leaves collected during the Fall of 2013. The leaf disks were cut by briefly softening the leaves in DI water (~ 5 m), and then cutting with a number 5 cork borer. The leaf disks were cut on 11 March 2015 and refidgerated.

The bottles were arranged in the greenhouse in the "humid room" in 5 blocks
